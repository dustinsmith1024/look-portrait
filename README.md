# META Description

What do you want the description to be?

# Galleries

Add a new gallery just copy the 'gallery-template.html' or an old gallery folder. Try to keep it in the 'galleries' folder.  Edit the top image to be whatever you want to show up when the page is first shown.  That image should also be the 10th one in the list.  This is kind of wierd but it made the Javascript easier and simpler for you to update.

# Images

You can organize the images however you want, but I would try to keep them inside a folder structure that somewhat mimicks the gallery names your using.

# Resources

Just edit the 'P' tag of the resources page.

# About

Just edit the about.html page. Feel free to change up the structure.
