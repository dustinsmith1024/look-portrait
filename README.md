# Galleries

Add a new gallery just copy the 'gallery-template.html' or another gallery file. Try to keep it in the 'galleries' folder for organizations sake.  

Edit the top image to be whatever you want to show up when the page is first shown.  That image should also be the 10th one in the list.  This is kind of wierd but it made the Javascript easier and simpler for you to update.  

Then once the gallery is ready you can add a link to the homepage. There are 2 links to change for a gallery. There is one that wraps the image thumbnail and another right below it. Just make those go to '/galleries/new-gallery.html' or whatever you name it.

# Images

You can organize the images however you want, but I would try to keep them inside a folder structure that somewhat mimicks the gallery names your using.

The thumbnails for the homepage need to be 300x200. If they are not this size then things might get wierd.

Images in these galleries have a maximum height of 600 pixels (like your old site). The maximum width that will show on the screen is 780. They will resize to fit the area though so you dont have to be perfect on these. If the width is too big it will scale the height down nicely.  I stole images from your site and they looked good.

# Resources

Just edit the 'P' tag of the resources page.

# About

Just edit the about.html page. Feel free to change up the structure or shoot me a question if you want it to look different.

# Google Analytics

I set this up for you cause it takes like 2 mins and gives all sorts of good data.  I will add your google account and then you just go to google.com/analytics to see your info.
